### Gentoo ebuilds for non-tree packages

Contained in this repository are some ebuilds for packages that I use or have used in the past.  I try to keep these packages up-to-date, but in the event that any of the packages need updating, please file an issue report on GitHub.

### Notable packages

- `dev-embedded/cc65` C Compiler and Assembler for 6502-based computers and video game consoles.
- `media-video/ndi-sdk-bin` NewTek NDI SDK (needed to compile `obs-ndi`)
- `media-video/DistroAV`Plugin for the Open Broadcaster System to support NDI A/V-over-IP communication
